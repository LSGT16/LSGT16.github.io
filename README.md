Basic Git workflow:

`git add .` //to stage your changes to be committed
`git commit -m "ejemplo" ` //to commit your changes, replace "ejemplo" with a message describing the changes you made
`git push` //to put your local commits onto github

Collaboration:
`git pull` //to put changes made by other people (that were pushed onto the github) into your local copy
